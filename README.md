# Santex - React - Challenge


The tools used to develop this challenge were: React, Scss, BEM, JS, Redux and more.


This game was developed to ***support mobile and desktop devices***. To achieve this the ***mobile-first*** approach was considered to write the styles of the pages.


In order to have a high code quality and understandability, the project was divided in small modules/components.
